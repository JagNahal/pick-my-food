# Pick My Food
 
Pick My Food uses Python and Travel Advisor's API to output a high rated restaurant from the Greater Vancouver Area based on what you are craving! 🍽️

## Motivation

My friends and I often spent too long deciding where to eat due to the abundance of option. I decided that having something choose for us would save us time and make for a fun project.

## What I Learned 

- Taught myself to call the Travel Advisor API in order to randomly output a restaurant based on an inputted cuisine type

- Learned to create functions that query JSON files to extract restaurant info including names, cuisines, and websites based on the user's inputted cuisine.

## What's Next For Pick My Food 

Eventually I would like to add filters for specific price points to make sure no users feel alienated due to the program outputting a restaurant that costs within the hundreds. Adding the option to choose other locations would also allow people from across the world to use this program.
